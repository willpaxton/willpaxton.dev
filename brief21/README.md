## Technology Student Association (TSA) State/National Webmaster Project 2021  

This website was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with the Bootstrap 5 Framework.

An earlier version of the site won first place at the Tennessee State TSA Webmaster competition and 6th in the finals for the National TSA Webmaster competition.

This was my second major code-built website, which I am proud of considering my little experience with Bootstrap 5 before building this site.  The total development time for this site was around 2 weeks, but I was basing it off of the first version of the site (which was NOT pretty and also took about 2 weeks).  

Note: the 404.html page was not used on the live site.

## Update 12/8/2022:
Since I am out of high school and finished with TSA competitions, I wanted to open-source the work that I did to help those who may be looking at these competitions for the first time.  Being able to see previous examples can be really helpful when you are new to web design and coding.  I congratulate you for even approaching these competitions as they are valuable to build your skills in this ever-expanding field early on.  

Please, DO NOT use this code in your projects, but please use it as reference to see what has been done in the past.
